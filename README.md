# PokemonDamageCalculator

In this project I'll try to build a custom damage calculator for Pok√®mon games. 
The idea is to vuild something similar to the one of pokemon showdown, but utilizing python and (for now) working with a CLI.

For the dataset I'll use to retrieve pokemon and move's informations, I'll use this one I found on Kaggle:
